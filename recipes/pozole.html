        <p>Pozole is a fan favorite in my family. Though particularly a holiday comida, you cant go wrong making this any given weekend to enjoy with your family. This recipe is a traditional Mexican pork soup cooked with hominy and flavoured with red guajillo chiles for a deep smoky flavor. Serve with shredded lettuce or cabbage, cilantro, radishes, onions or whatever you prefer.</p>
