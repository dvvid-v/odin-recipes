        <p>Mole (moe-lay) is a traditional mexican dish made out of different chiles, nuts, spices and chocolate. It is known for it's rich, earthy and nutty flavors. In Mexico, mole is reserved for big special events such as weddings, quinceaneras, baptisms or even a birthday will do! Regardless of the event or day, mole will always be a staple of mexican cuisine. Though I am biased in my love for mole (my favorite dish) this dish is a definite must try.</p>
